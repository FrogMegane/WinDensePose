# Denseponse for Windows
## Configure, build and run in several simple steps.

The original Densepose code can be find here https://github.com/facebookresearch/DensePose.
I had to make a lot of small changes to make it work under windows. Most of my changes are pretty small but without them it was not possible to run it. I forked the original repository in https://github.com/NikolaySt/DensePose along with https://github.com/NikolaySt/cocoapi .

## Installation under Windows
